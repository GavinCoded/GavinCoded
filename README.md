## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gavin / GavinStrikes
I am a reverse engineer and I research cybersecurity
I love researching when I'm bored and overcomplicate things.
You may know me for owning the company [Oblivity Software LLC](https://ixviixvi.github.io/company/), which is focused on cybersecurity.
If you wish to contact me, you can do so with this email: contact@gavinstrikes.cloud.



## Programming Languages (I'm bad at both)
