## Misc

I use [**Fedora Linux Workstation Edition**](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) as my main operating system, along with the [**GNOME desktop environment**](https://www.gnome.org/).  
Here's a [screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GavinCoded/GavinCoded/refs/heads/main/desktop/Screenshot%20From%202025-07-12%2017-59-40.png) of my desktop!

When I need Windows, I use **Microsoft Windows 10 LTSC 2021**.

My preferred IDEs are JetBrains IDEs primarily **WebStorm**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, and **CLion**.  
For quick text editing or small file changes, I use **Sublime Text**.

I use **Mozilla Firefox** (donâ€™t tell me to use Brave) as my primary web browser and have been using it for around 5 years.
